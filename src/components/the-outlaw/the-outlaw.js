                        The Outlaw has a desire for revolution partly to change the world for the better and partly for the anarchy involved. 
                        They have a disdain for rules, regulation and conformity that would remove any form of their freedom of choice (or anyone else's).
                        They are good at the core but anger is part of their motivation, which can become the dominant force.
                        Without a fight, they are lost.
